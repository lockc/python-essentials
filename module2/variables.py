# The PEP 8 -- Style Guide for Python Code recommends the following naming convention for variables and functions in Python:
#
# - variable names should be lowercase, with words separated by underscores to improve readability (e.g., var, my_variable)
# - function names follow the same convention as variable names (e.g., fun, my_function)
# - It's also possible to use mixed case (e.g., myVariable), but only in contexts where that's already the prevailing style, to retain backwards compatibility with the adopted convention.
#

var = "hello world!"
print(var)

var=1
print(var)

var=var + 1
print(var)

var += 1
print(var)
